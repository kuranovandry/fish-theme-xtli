# fish-theme-xtli

A minimal theme forked from the oh-my-fish/theme-cbjohnson theme with elegant vi-mode indicator.

Install with [fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher) using command `fisher add znculee/fish-theme-xtli`.

If the prompt_pwd shows abbreviated version even with enough space, you may add `set fish_prompt_pwd_dir_length 0` in your `~/.config/fish/config.fish`.
